When the intent is to extract all the data from a particular group you can invoke the function as specified in the Main.py

Acess :
The user should have a valid OAut Key, you can generate the Key quite easily in yammer ones you have network admin privilleges. 

Limitations of Yammer :
Its important to inderstand the limitations of yammer API's response. Yammer would not respond more than 20 messages per request. 
Yammer Time out period has to be respected as well. More the number of request with in the time period mention will result in Errors. 

Parameters of the function :

groupid : Pass on group id of yammer 
Older_than : Should always be  ''
file_cnt : Pass 1

Output :

The function would out data in a set of json files in the folder mentioned within the function. 
ex : ( 1.json, 2.json, 3.json. etc.. ) 

What does the function Do :
Invokes the REST-API : Message_AboutTopic and downloads all the data beloging to a particular Yammer group.  

The First section gets invoked when the older than '' , which means the first iteration , after the first file 1.json is craeted the code looks for the flag ( older_than) in the metadata
if the flag is false ( which means that there are no more data belonging to the group ) the loop would finish gracefully. 
Else we call the same function recursively. 

The Loop continues till the end of extraction.
