Yammer is getting adopted widely for enterprise social networking. Here i present various functions which would help the community of social media analyst to extract data from yammer and build analytics on topof them. 

The Entire code base is in python 2.7. I had used Jupyter Noteboks to develop and test the packages. 

Over time will discuss differnt issues that i faced with yammer API's. I see the API's are not well documented and not stable enough. 

Access: 

Any member would need an accesstoken to download data from yammer. The OAuth2 Key is not a top of the quality secure thing, so be very discrete in sharing and in usage. 

On the Acess front, A user generating the Key needs to be a Network Admin in yammer. Super admin privileges are only required if you need to use the Data Export API.
